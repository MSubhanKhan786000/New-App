            Delivery Process
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Rent It will deliver the dress directly or through a courier partner
            in accordance with your selected design and size specifications.
            Delivery will be made on or before the requested delivery date. If
            the dress is not delivered by the requested date, you are entitled
            to a refund of rental costs and charges without any further
            obligation from Rent It.

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The delivery will be made to the address specified by you when
            placing the rental order. Rent It reserves the right to refuse
            delivery to locations where no one is available to accept physical
            delivery. Please note that the article is deemed to be delivered in
            good order and repair unless otherwise noted and signed by both
            parties.
